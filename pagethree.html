    <h2>What I know about Marvel</h2>
    <p>
        Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now known as Timely
        Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that
        the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko
        and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary
        brand.
